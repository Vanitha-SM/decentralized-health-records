## **Decentralized Medical Records Management System**
  
A blockchain-based system to securely manage and access medical records, allowing patients to control access permissions while ensuring data integrity and privacy.

---

## About  
The **Decentralized Medical Records Management System** is designed to provide a secure, patient-centric approach to medical data management. Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), this project ensures that sensitive healthcare information remains tamper-proof and accessible only to authorized users. Traditional centralized systems are prone to breaches, unauthorized access, and limited patient control over data. This project addresses these issues by decentralizing storage and providing a secure, immutable ledger for access permissions.  

---

## Features  
- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Uses IPFS to store medical records securely and avoid single points of failure.  
- **Blockchain-based Permissions**: Employs Ethereum smart contracts to manage access rights immutably.  
- **Patient-Controlled Data Access**: Patients can grant or revoke access to healthcare providers using a user-friendly interface.  
- **Secure Authentication**: Integration with MetaMask ensures secure user identity verification.  
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Blockchain guarantees that medical records cannot be altered without patient authorization.  

---

## Requirements  
- **Operating System**: 64-bit OS (Windows 10, macOS, or Linux).  
- **Development Environment**: Node.js (v14+), Python 3.6+, and npm for dependencies.  
- **Blockchain Framework**: Ethereum blockchain using Hardhat for deployment and testing.  
- **Frontend Development**: ReactJS for the user interface.  
- **Blockchain Libraries**:  
  - Web3.js: To interact with Ethereum.  
  - OpenZeppelin: For secure, pre-built smart contract components.  
- **Storage System**: IPFS for decentralized storage.  
- **Authentication**: MetaMask wallet for secure user login.  
- **Testing Tools**: Hardhat and Mocha for smart contract testing.  
- **Additional Dependencies**: Axios for API calls, dotenv for environment variable management.
